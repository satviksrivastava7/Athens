# Athens.ai
## Train, Test, Predict...
Athens.ai is an initiative to provide no code based Machine Learning services. It is an auto ML platform that only requires dataset (currently only accepted in csv format) and it will take care of the rest of the model training.
Athens.ai preprocesses your dataset, tunes it, and trains it to get efficient and maximized output. The trained model can be downloaded along with the results.
The web application is under development, currently it works only for classification problems.
However, soon it would be able to train regression, reinforcement, and even advanced neural network models.
